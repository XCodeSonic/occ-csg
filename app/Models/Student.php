     *     Officer is scoped via officer_event_id.
     *  2. The student's own department must be one this event is scoped
     *     to (see EventModel::includesDepartment) — an event narrowed to
     *     e.g. BSIT + BEd should never track (or later mark absent/
     *     penalize) a BSBA student just because they happen to scan.
     *
     * Callers that need a *different* error message for each gate (e.g.
     * ScanAttendance, which tells an officer "wrong department" instead
     * of "not an attendee at all") check the two conditions separately
     * rather than calling this — this method is for callers that only
     * need the combined yes/no (e.g. UpdateStudentPhoto's photo lock).
