     * Top $limit students by current attendance streak — global, across
     * every department and every event (spec: "global leader board of
     * students streak visible in the Dashboard top 5"). Students with no
     * streak at all (current === 0) never appear here; there's nothing
     * to rank them on.
     *
     * Ties on current streak are broken by who scanned their most recent
     * attendance record first — spec's own example: a session opens at
     * 1:00pm, Student A scans at 1:05:20pm, Student B scans at 1:06:10pm
     * — A is faster, so A outranks B despite an equal streak. This reads
     * ComputeAttendanceStreaks' latest_scan_at (the scanned_at of each
     * student's single most recent real scan — see that class's
     * docblock for why it's never an older one), so the same two
     * students can trade places the very next session: whichever of them
     * scans first *this* time is who wins the tiebreak next time the
     * leaderboard is built, since only the latest scan is ever compared.
     * A student tied on streak but with no scan at all yet (only
     * possible at streak 0, which is already excluded above) would sort
     * last among ties.
     *
