     * after the response is sent. dispatch(...)->afterResponse() runs
     * the closure in this same PHP-FPM worker once the response has
     * already been flushed to the browser (via fastcgi_finish_request()
     * where the host supports it — effectively every shared host on
     * PHP-FPM does), so a full-school export no longer ties up the HTTP
     * request/response cycle (and can't get killed by a webserver/proxy
     * timeout that a bigger set_time_limit() can't touch) — this is the
     * actual fix for "the PDF isn't generating", not just a progress bar
     * painted over the same blocking call.
     *
     * ->onConnection('sync') is explicit and deliberate: whatever
     * QUEUE_CONNECTION happens to be set to elsewhere, this dispatch
     * must never require a queue worker process, since the spec rules
     * that out for shared hosting.
