 * The master-report counterpart to StartRosterReportGeneration: same

 * via dispatch(...)->onConnection('sync')->afterResponse()" shape,
 * just for a report that spans several events instead of one.
 *
 * event_ids keeps every selected event, in the order the person picked
 * them — that order becomes the left-to-right column order in the
 * output (see BuildMasterRosterReport). event_id is still set, to the
 * first id in that list, purely to satisfy the existing not-null
 * foreign key on report_generations without needing a schema change —
 * every master-aware reader looks at event_ids, not event_id.
