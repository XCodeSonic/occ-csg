/**
 * Baseline security headers — Laravel sets none of these by default.
 * Nothing here changes behavior for a legitimate request; it only removes
 * a few free attack surfaces (clickjacking, MIME-sniffing) for an app
 * that handles student PII (names, photos, attendance/penalty history).
 *
 * Deliberately conservative: this app is a same-origin SPA (see
 * routes/web.php's catch-all serving the same `app` view react-router
 * handles client-side) with no third-party embeds, trackers, or CDN
 * dependencies — Instrument Sans is bundled by Vite and served from this
 * origin (see resources/js/app.tsx), not loaded from Google Fonts. If a
 * third-party script/font/embed is ever added, its origin needs to be
 * added to the relevant directive below or it will be silently blocked
 * by the browser, not by this middleware.

        //     modules and HMR updates from its own origin (not "self"),
        //     and @viteReactRefresh injects an inline <script> preamble.

        //     Windows), and browsers reject a bracketed IPv6 literal as
